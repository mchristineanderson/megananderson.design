  <div class="overview">
    <h3 class="overline">Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Material is an adaptable design system — backed by open-source code — that
      helps teams easily build high-quality digital experiences. As a visual
      designer on the team, I contributed to the design system and launch of
      Material Theming, providing the ability to systematically customize
      Material Design to better reflect a product’s brand. I was awarded a
      design patent for my contributions to componentry, published demos, system
      guidance, and tools to significantly improve the way digital products are
      designed and built.

    <p>
      Google Travel is a unified trip planning experience that helps users
      schedule their trips from start to finish. As a lead visual designer for
      Travel’s Hotel vertical, I contributed to the UI framework for the Hotel’s
      placesheet, and partnered with Travel’s horizontal system leads and
      engineering to integrate unified components and patterns from Google
      Material into the product. I launched feature level multi-arm experiments
      based on user research and business goals, aiming to make discovering and
      comparing hotels easier for users.

  <h2>Felt</h2>
  <div class="subhead">
    A design tool for building user interfaces visually with Flutter.
  </div>
  <div class="overview">
    <h3 class="overline">Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Felt is a design tool informed by real-world engineering requirements. We
      set out to kill handoff, and help designer and developers work from the
      same source. In Felt designers build with widgets, which are code, to
      configure properties, create design tokens, and combine widgets atomically
      into screens. Every aspect of a Felt design is Dart code, with generated
      code using Google’s Build Runner framework. What users design in Felt is
      what appears in the production application. As a co-founder and product
      designer, I bootstrapped the project and designed an early version of
      Felt’s macOS app, and a design framework for configuring widgets. We
      achieved some major milestones, like enabling Felt designs to be editable
      by both designers and developers for two way collaboration through GitHub.
      While working on the project we joined a startup incubator, Labs at
      WeWork, and continued to work remotely on the project during 2020.

      GreenCrate is a California based startup formed in 2020 aiming to bring

      testing plan and supporting designs for a series of video based greenhouse
      tours and virtual farmers market experiences the team was experimenting
      with. The Android and iOS application are currently under development.

      BillGuru brings clarity to the stressful and confusing process of figuring

      available. As product designer on the team, I led visual design and
      defined core flows across the product. Born at a Hackathon in San
      Francisco, the idea won grand prize, earning it a spot as one of ten
      finalist teams in the national FinCapDev Competition. The app is no longer

  <div class="overview">
    <h3 class="overline">Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Material Design is a visual language created by Google in 2014 that
      synthesizes principles of good design with an underlying system that aims
      to unify experiences across platforms and device sizes. I joined the team
      as a visual designer a year after the initial launch, and contributed to
      fostering adoption and consistent use of the system across Google and with
      3rd parties. I published articles to the design spec, component sticker
      sheets, and furthered existing guidance with specific use cases. I
      collaborated with product teams though weekly design reviews to helped
      apply guidance to product specific use cases. I partnered with engineering
      to build out component libraries to spec, demos, and tooling. I also
      evangelized the system’s use with 3rd parties as a Material Reviewer at
      Google’s annual I/O developer conference.
