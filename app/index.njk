  <h2>Material Design</h2>
  <div class="subhead">An adaptable design system.</div>
  <div class="overview">
    <h3 class="overline">Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Material is an adaptable design system — backed by open-source code — that
      helps teams easily build high-quality digital experiences. As a visual
      designer on the team, I contributed to the design system and launch of
      Material Theming, providing the ability to systematically customize Material
      Design to better reflect a product’s brand. I was awarded a design patent
      for my contributions to componentry, published demos, system guidance, and
      tools to significantly improve the way digital products are designed and
      built.

  <div class="overview">

    <p>
      Google Travel is a unified trip planning experience that helps users
      schedule their trips from start to finish. As a lead visual designer for
      Travel’s Hotel vertical, I contributed to the UI framework for the Hotel’s
      placesheet, and partnered with Travel’s horizontal system leads and
      engineering to integrate unified components and patterns from Google
      Material into the product. I launched feature level multi-arm experiments
      based on user research and business goals, aiming to make discovering and
      comparing hotels easier for users.

  <h2>Felt</h2>
  <div class="subhead">
    A design tool for building user interfaces visually with Flutter.
  </div>
  <div class="overview">
    <h3 class="overline">Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Felt is a design tool informed by real-world engineering requirements.  We
      set out to kill handoff, and help designer and developers work from the same
      source.  In Felt designers build with widgets, which are code, to configure
      properties, create design tokens, and combine widgets atomically into
      screens. Every aspect of a Felt design is Dart code, with generated code
      using Google’s Build Runner framework. What users design in Felt is what
      appears in the production application.  As a co-founder and product
      designer, I bootstrapped the project and designed an early version of Felt’s
      macOS app, and a design framework for configuring widgets. We achieved some
      major milestones, like enabling Felt designs to be editable by both
      designers and developers for two way collaboration through GitHub. While
      working on the project we joined a startup incubator, Labs at WeWork, and
      continued to work remotely on the project during 2020.

  <div class="overview">
    <h3 class="overline">Overview</h3>
    <p>
      As an integral part of the Material Tooling team, I redefined the visual
      language and framework for web and macOS based design tooling that aimed to
      express Material guidance within a design workflow. I was awarded a design
      patent for my contributions to tooling that supports adjusting attributes of
      components and theming within Material’s design system, as well as a
      proposed a hub for discovering and accessing Material tools and resources.

      GreenCrate is a California based startup formed in 2020 aiming to bring
      organic produce, at affordable prices, directly from the greenhouse to your
      doorstep. As lead product designer, I designed GreenCrate’s core user flows
      and defined the visual language for the team, and defined a user testing
      plan and supporting designs for a series of video based greenhouse tours and
      virtual farmers market experiences the team was experimenting with. The
      Android and iOS application are currently under development.

    <p>
      BillGuru brings clarity to the stressful and confusing process of figuring
      out how to pay your bills when you don't have enough money to cover all of
      them. The product enables users to organize and track their bills, and
      calculates which ones are most important to pay with the money they have
      available. As product designer on the team, I led visual design and defined
      core flows across the product. Born at a Hackathon in San Francisco, the
      idea won grand prize, earning it a spot as one of ten finalist teams in the
      national FinCapDev Competition. The app is no longer active.

  <h2>Material Design Guidelines</h2>
  <div class="subhead">
    Helping teams apply Material & extend system guidance.
  </div>
  <div class="overview">
    <h3 class="overline">Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Material Design is a visual language created by Google in 2014 that
      synthesizes principles of good design with an underlying system that aims to
      unify experiences across platforms and device sizes. I joined the team as a
      visual designer a year after the initial launch, and contributed to
      fostering adoption and consistent use of the system across Google and with
      3rd parties. I published articles to the design spec, component sticker
      sheets, and furthered existing guidance with specific use cases. I
      collaborated with product teams though weekly design reviews to helped apply
      guidance to product specific use cases. I partnered with engineering to
      build out component libraries to spec, demos, and tooling. I also
      evangelized the system’s use with 3rd parties as a Material Reviewer at
      Google’s annual I/O developer conference.
